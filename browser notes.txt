If dataview available then array buffer available too

If no dataview then arraybuffer may be available or not

If no arraybuffer then no data view

Appending string to blob builder does not work
If string used then cannot use blob builder

Firefox has arraybuffer so can use blob builder, but not data view

IE has no array buffer, so cannot use blob builder, must use string

Only Chrome generates suitable filenames. JSZip - Downloadify works with IE and Firefox. 

Checks:

- If Chrome, require saveAs. File created as blobs and saved using saveAs. Optionally zip it first.
- If Firefox require Dataview, using ArrayBuffer. 
- If IE require Dataview, using string. Can be made to work with blobbuilder library from eligrey but no need - just pass the string buffer to JSZip
